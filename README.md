A Reproducible Data Analysis Workflow with R Markdown, Git, Make, and Docker
================

This workshop will give you an overview of the challenges with reproducibility
and how we think these challenges can be adressed to guarantee long-term
computational reproducibility of scientific analyses.

## Target audience

This approach is suitable for R users that appreciate full computational reproducibility. 

## Installation

You can install the latest version of the `repro` package for R from
[GitHub](https://github.com/aaronpeikert/repro) with:

``` r
if(!requireNamespace("remotes"))install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("aaronpeikert/repro")
```
