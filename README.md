A Reproducible Data Analysis Workflow with R Markdown, Git, Make, and Docker
================

This workshop will give you an overview of the challenges with reproducibility
and how we think these challenges can be adressed to guarantee long-term
computational reproducibility of scientific analyses.

## Target audience

This approach is suitable for R users that appreciate full computational reproducibility. 

## Installation

You can install the latest version of the `repro` package for R from
[GitHub](https://github.com/aaronpeikert/repro) with:

``` r
if(!requireNamespace("remotes"))install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("aaronpeikert/repro")
```

## Presentations

- This is my presentation on the workflow for the *Online Symposium:
Reproducing Analyses in Biological Psychology* (Nov 23, 2020) organized by early career researchers of the DGPA and the
DGPS: [Slides](https://brandmaier.github.io/reproducible-data-analysis-materials/BioPsy2020.html#1)

_The presentation source code is fully reproducible._
