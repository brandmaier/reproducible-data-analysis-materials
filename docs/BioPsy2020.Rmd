# Sources of Failure to Reproduce Results

.pull-right[ ![](images/markus-spiske-yUTgdQkbd7c-unsplash.jpg) ]

1. *Multiple versions of scripts/data* (e.g., dataset has changed over, i.e., was further cleaned or extended)

--

2. *Multiple scripts* in a pipeline; unclear which scripts should be executed in which order

--

3. *Copy&paste errors* (e.g., inconsistency between reported result and reproduced result)

--

4. Broken *software dependencies* (e.g., analysis broken after update, missing package)

## Standardized Makefile

- contains a number of recipes
- Each recipe contains its dependencies and commands to create a product
- There is a default recipe (defined entry point)
- There is an „all“ recipe to create everything 
- Recipes can depend on other recipes and files

---

## Example Makefile

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
all: manuscript.pdf

manuscript.pdf: data/iris_prepped.csv manuscript.Rmd
  Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::render("manuscript.Rmd")'

data/iris_prepped.csv: R/prepare_data.R data/iris.csv
  Rscript -e 'source("R/prepare_data.R")'
```

--

Further examples: download a remote file, remove lines from a file, correct faulty data entries, call an external program

## Docker

Docker is basically a shareable virtual machine that runs identically on any computer (Linux, macOS, Windows)
You can either provide a short recipe how to create a container (few kilobytes) or the entire container (few gigabytes)
With recipes, we provide machine-readable instructions how to create a container from publicly available sources, e.g., 
Rocker project (Boettiger & Eddelbuettel, 2017), with pre-configured Docker images including R/Rstudio
Microsoft R Application Network (MRAN) providing CRAN snapshots in their „time machine“

---

# The easy way

- The R package `renv` helps you to set up and restore project-specific local environments in R

- Create a private R library with `renv::init()` (the project will now always rely on the local library)

- Update a library with `renv::snapshot()` 

- Restore a library with `renv::restore()`

### But is this enough?

# Examples of Non-Reproducible Code in R

Here are some examples of non-reproducible code that cannot be captured easily from within a given R environment

### 1.	Bugfix in random number generator in R between R 3.5 and R 3.6

```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(1234); 
sample(1:10, 5) 
```

--

```{r eval=FALSE}
2 6 5 8 9 (R3.5)
```

--

```{r eval=FALSE}
10 6 5 4 1 (R3.6.1)
```
--

### 2.	Loading data has different defaults from R 4.0+

`read.csv()` now has stringsAsFactors = TRUE
	
Code that assumes default behavior (which later may change) may break

---

#  Examples of Non-Reproducible Code in R
	
### 3.	Locale-dependent behavior (e.g., English vs Lithuania):

````{r eval=FALSE}
sort(state.abb) 

[1] "AK" "AL" "AR" "AZ" "CA" "CO" "CT" "DE" "FL" "GA" "HI" "IA" 
[13] "ID" "IL" "IN" "KY" "KS" "LA" "MA" "MD" "ME" "MI" "MN" "MO" 
[25] "MS" "MT" "NC" "ND" "NE" "NH" "NY" "NJ" "NM" "NV" "OH" "OK" 
[37] "OR" "PA" "RI" "SC" "SD" "TN" "TX" "UT" "VA" "VT" "WA" "WI" 
[49] "WY" "WV"
```

# Docker

#### Docker is basically a shareable virtual machine that runs identically on any computer (Linux, macOS, Windows)

Sharing a container:

- the entire _container_ (few gigabytes)
- using a short _recipe_ how to create a container (few kilobytes), or


With recipes, we provide machine-readable instructions how to create a container from publicly available sources, e.g., 
Rocker project (Boettiger & Eddelbuettel, 2017), with pre-configured Docker images including R/Rstudio
Microsoft R Application Network (MRAN) providing CRAN snapshots in their „time machine“

---

# Containers

### Docker containers 

- guarantee identical execution of its contents across platforms (and time) 

--

- can run interactively: R/Rstudio can run in the container (i.e., there is no need to ever run the analysis in your local computing environment)

--

- Analyses can be run in different containers (simulating different package versions) to find out what downstream updates broke your code / your results

# Outlook

	
#### Long-term sustainability is a continuing challenge for the community

We need academic repositories for scientific software/environments that
Are freely accessible (no commercial interests)
Guarantue long-term reproducibility (independent of short-term grants)
Provide software infrastructure and computational environments
