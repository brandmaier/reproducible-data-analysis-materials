# A Reproducible Data Analysis Workflow with R Markdown, Git, Make, & Docker
 
In this talk, I describe a workflow to ensure long-term reproducibility of data analyses in the R statistical computing environment. The workflow ensures meeting the primary goals that 1) changes at any time (during development, review, and post-publication) are tracked, tagged, and documented while earlier versions of both data and code remain accessible, 2) the reporting of statistical results is consistent with the actual statistical results (dynamic report generation), 3) the analysis can be exactly reproduced by someone else and/or at a later point in time even if the computing platform has changed (computational reproducibility).
